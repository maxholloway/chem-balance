How to run the program:
1.) Click on the "Balance Equations" icon
2.) Enter the file path of the text file containing (include the file name as well)
3.) See the solutions appear on the screen!

How to make the text file:
1.) Open a text editor (preferably not textedit)
2.) Enter a reaction on one line of the text file
3.) If there is more than one reaction, then enter it on
	new lines. DO NOT ENTER MORE THAN ONE REACTION ON ONE
	LINE.
4.) Separate compounds by spaces, a plus-sign, and then the following compound.
5.) Use the following symbol as the yield symbol: "->" (without the quotes).
	Be sure to click space before and after entering this, because it is
	not a part of the compounds.
6.) If a compound has a charge, simply denote this by a "+" or "-" for 
	a positive and negative charge, respectively. Be sure that this is 
	connected to the rest of the compound (i.e. not separated by any spaces).
	If it is separated by any space then the program will mess up.
	Good Example: Ca+2 + (OH)-
	Good Example: Ca+2 + (OH)-1
	Bad Example: Ca +2 +(OH) -
	Bad Example: Ca+ 2 + (OH)-
7.) Use the following reactions as examples:

	KMnO4 + H2C2O4 + H2SO4 -> CO2 + MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O
	H3N + Br2 -> N2 + (NH4)+ + Br-
	NO + I- + H+ -> NH4+ + I2 + H2O
	
	These reactions meet all of the conditions for entering proper reactions.
