How to run the program:
0.) Download the file "runnable"

1.) Open the file and double click the file called "chem-balance.jar"

2.) To enter equations manually, leave the option as "manual" and click "Go"

3.) To enter upload equations from a textfile, click the dropdown menu, select "Textfile", and then click "Go"


How to make a reaction equation:

1.) Separate compounds by spaces, a plus-sign, and then the following compound.

2.) Use the following symbol as the yield symbol: "->" (without the quotes).
	Be sure to click space before and after entering this, because it is
	not a part of the compounds.
	
3.) If a compound has a charge, simply denote this by a "+" or "-" for 
	a positive and negative charge, respectively. Be sure that this is 
	connected to the rest of the compound (i.e. not separated by any spaces).
	If it is separated by any space then the program will not execute properly.
        
	Good Example: Ca+2 + (OH)-
	
        Good Example: Ca+2 + (OH)-1
	
        Bad Example: Ca +2 +(OH) -
	
        Bad Example: Ca+ 2 + (OH)-

4.) Use the following reactions as examples:

	KMnO4 + H2C2O4 + H2SO4 -> CO2 + MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O
	
        H3N + Br2 -> N2 + (NH4)+ + Br-
	
        NO + I- + H+ -> NH4+ + I2 + H2O
	
       
	These reactions meet all of the conditions for entering proper reactions.

How to make the text file:

1.) Open a text editor (one that can save in ".txt" format)

2.) Enter a reaction on one line of the text file


3.) If there is more than one reaction, then enter it on
	new lines. DO NOT ENTER MORE THAN ONE REACTION ON ONE
	LINE.
